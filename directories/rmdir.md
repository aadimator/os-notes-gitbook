# Let's Delete a Directory with rmdir
Now, where there's construction, the destruction follows. There'll be a time when you want to delete some directory that you accidentally made or no longer need. We got you covered there too. Just say the magic words (or more specifically, type them) and your wish will be granted. 
```
    $ rmdir Test
```
This will find the "Test" directory in the `cwd` and delete it.
