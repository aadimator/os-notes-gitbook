# Find where you are
Imagine that you moved into a new city and you don't know anyone else there. You don't know any of the maps and directions and there are no board signs either to guide you. Well that'll be the case if you've never used Linux before and you migrated from another OS like Windows. The very first thing that you'll need in order to survive in this new city is to get a sense of where you are. Whenever you feel like you are lost in the directories, you can easily find out about the directory that you are currently in. Imagine that. You won't have to go knocking on someone's door asking them about where you are. You'll just have to write a simple command in the Terminal and you'll immediately know where you are. Isn't that cool? Okay, no further delay. Let's reveal the magic spell, shall we?
```
    $ pwd
```
Yeah, just that. Just type `pwd` in the Terminal and you'll know where you are. In case you're wondering, `pwd` stands for `print-working-directory`.
