# Let's Create a Directory with mkdir
If you are tired of just roaming around the Linux, and eager to create something yours, I've got just the right tool for you. Let me introduce you to the `mkdir` (stands for (can you guess it?) make-directory). Here's how to use it:
```
    $ mkdir Test
```
This will create a new directory named "Test" in the `cwd`. It's as simple as that. You just have to provide the name of the directory that you want to create and it will create it for you and place it in the `cwd`.
