# The Command Prompt
When you first open the terminal, you are greeted with a cryptic looking command prompt like this :
```
    aadam@my-pc:~$
```
Although, this can be customized by the user, this is the default Command Prompt in Ubuntu.
Now, let's break it down:

- `aadam` name of the current user
- `my-pc` the name of the system you are running it on
- ` ~ ` You already know what this is ( Hint : cwd ) In this case, it is /home/aadam
- ` $ ` The prompt symbol. This denotes the end of the command prompt, your input will appear after this.

From now on, instead of writing the whole command prompt as shown above, I will only display the prompt symbol to indicate the commands.
```
    $ some command
