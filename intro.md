My name is **Aadam**. I am doing BS Computer Science from **University of Haripur (UOH)**. I love coding as this is the time when I feel most alive and closer to my Creator because I am creating something, something mine, something original.

I am passionate about *programming* and read a lot of books and articles. I can do so easily because I love it, and if you love something, it doesn't feel like a chore, but fun instead. Because of this, constant learning, I am somewhat good at programming, of course. I have participated in several on-spot programming competitions and seminars.  

Because of my reputation as a programmer, I've been assigned a tiresome and difficult task of explaining Operating System concepts via programming to my class-fellows by my prestigious teacher, *Kamran H. Khan*. Programming isn't tiresome or difficult but explaining it is, at least for me. Although public speaking is not one of my strong suits, I am willing to do my best knowing that this is a great opportunity for me to polish my skills. What doesn't kill you makes you stronger. 

## What to expect
These are the notes that I prepare for myself before presentations. The purpose of these presentations is to show some operating systems concepts like *process creation, process scheduling, thread creation* etc. We'll be using the **Linux Operating System** as this is the most customizable and developer friendly OS and we can easily see what's happening under the hood. We'll use the **C** language for programming as this is the lowest level programming language after assembly language and the most widely used system-programming language.

I'll sometimes use examples from [Operating System Concepts](http://www.amazon.com/Operating-System-Concepts-Abraham-Silberschatz/dp/1118063333/ref=dp_ob_title_bk) which has some C programs to help solidify the operating system concepts like forking etc.

Another thing, I'll try my best to explain these difficult concepts and programs but I'm sure there will be times when I can't do justice to some topic or when I understood it wrong, so keep in mind that I am a student and not an expert, be it Linux administration or low-level C programs, but I can assure you of one thing; if later on I find that there is a better way to explain something or a better way to do some task than what I already did before, I'll definitely share it with you. You can count on it.
