# View the File using `cat` or `less`
You can view the contents of the file by using either `cat` or `less` command. The difference between these two is that `cat` just prints out all the contents of the file on the terminal while `less` command give you extra control over the content like scrolling etc. and only shows the content that can fit on your screen. You can use the "arrow keys" to navigate inside the file and press `q` when you want to quit.
```
    $ cat file1

    $ less file1
```
